<h1> Core4 Reflections</h1>
<h2> Functions</h2>
<p> A function is a collection codes to define a certain action. This helps save time, repetition and make your code neat neat and compact. </p>
<p5> An analogy of this in real life would be that rather than bringing one book at a time and keep on going back and forth, you could put all of them on a cart and bring it at once. </p5>

<h3> Loops</h3>
<p4> Loops are when you make certain action repeat a certain number of times or it could also be forever, depending on how much you need it.</p4>

<p6> A analogy of loops in real life would be a wheel repeatedly going in circles.
